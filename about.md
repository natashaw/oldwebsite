### What is IEEE@IIT?

IEEE@IIT is Illinois Tech's student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). We are a student-run organization within the ECE Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology. We're a group of electrical/computer engineering and computer science students (undergrad and graduate) who want to have fun and meet new people, to learn about research and innovation in technology, to find ourselves and our passions, to help our community, and to get inspired to change the world!

Our mission is to provide a social, technical and professional community to the ECE student body. We want to help our ECE community gain knowledge, skills and networks that will help them through their academic and professional careers.

### What is IEEE?

The _Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers_, or _IEEE_, is the world’s leading professional association for the advancement of technology involving electricity. The purpose of IEEE as an organization is to disseminate knowledge of the theory and practice of all aspects of electrical, electronics, communications and computer engineering, as well as computer science, the allied Branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences. IEEE serves as a mean for students to further their professional and educational development.

Through its global membership, IEEE is a leading authority on areas ranging from aerospace systems, computers and telecommunications to biomedical engineering, electric power and consumer electronics among others. Members rely on IEEE as a source of technical and professional information, resources and services. To foster an interest in the engineering profession, IEEE also serves student members in colleges and universities around the world. Other important constituencies include prospective members and organizations that purchase IEEE products and participate in conferences or other IEEE programs.
